Main Bearing Analytical Model Repository

This directory contains the code to a wind turbine main bearing analytical model that estimates bearing loads and reliability using OpenFAST data and reference wind turbine parameters. This directory contains four primary files:

1] MainBearing_Analytical_Model contains the functions necessary to translate OpenFAST data, calculate bearing loads and L10 life

2] Example Folder runs this model using the 5MW RWT. Load_Estimation_Results folder contains the results from this example run. 

3] Validation folder contains the frame3DD source code, validation program, and example run of validation process

4] Report file compiles previous research, project motive, model formulation, and validation method.
